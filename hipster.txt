Kosmoceratops was a ceratopsid dinosaur that lived in what is now the U.S. state of Utah about 76.4–75.5 million years ago, during the Late Cretaceous. Specimens of the genus were discovered in Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument in 2006 and 2007. It had an estimated length of 4.5 m (15 ft) and weight of 1.2 t (1.3 short tons). Kosmoceratops (from Greek for "ornate horned face") was named for its skull, the most ornamented of any known dinosaur, with fifteen well-developed horns and horn-like structures. It had a triangular beak with a pointed tip, a blade-like nasal horn, and two horns that pointed up and to the sides, then downwards. The neck frill was short from front to back, with eight hook-like processes on the hind margin curving forwards, and two curving to the sides. Kosmoceratops grew rapidly and, like modern birds and mammals, had an elevated metabolism. Its teeth were adapted to chewing fibrous plants. (Full article...

The Café-Concert is an 1879 oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Édouard Manet, now in the collection of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. It is one of several works set in the Brasserie Reichshoffen on the Boulevard Marguerite-de-Rochechouart in Paris, depicting social life at the end of the 19th century. The three main figures in the work form a triangle, each seemingly unaware of the presence of the others; the waitress drinks beer, the woman at the bar smokes a cigarette and appears subdued, and the man watches the performance of singer "La Belle Polonaise", reflected in a mirror in the background. The figures of the individuals represented are not clearly defined, but modelled with brushstrokes. Manet was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and was a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.)
